## Curriculum Vitae

### Profile
I have recently completed a training course by Makers Academy, in order to change careers and pursue my real passion for technology by becoming a Software Developer. Previously, I was working as an IT Recruiter for over 6 years, primarily specialising in hiring Software Development professionals.  This was my chosen industry as I've always had a keen interest in technology - software development in particular - even going back to my school days when I completed a Software Engineering course during Sixth Form.

I am a hard-working individual who possesses a strong work-ethic and a genuine enthusiasm to continue to learn. I am a pragmatic and analytical thinker, who relishes problem-solving and the challenges they provide. This is why I feel my mindset is suited to Software Development and why I get so much enjoyment from coding.

### Career History:
#### Makers Academy 									Sept 2017 - Jan 2018
#### Software Developer in Training
Makers Academy are Europe's leading Web Development bootcamp. I have recently completed a 16 week course - consisting of 4 weeks of remote pre-course material followed by 12 weeks of on-site, intensive training - in order to retrain and pursue a career as a Full-Stack Software Developer.

##### Key Content / Skills:
* Self-learning - The primary skill Makers teach, is how to teach yourself new technologies. This is so that students are comfortable in learning a new technology and can do so quickly, when moving into a commercial environment.
* Agile principles - Makers are Agile enthusiasts and have students practicing Pair Programming throughout the course. Group projects also allows opportunity to run stand-ups and retros.
* Modern development practices - passionate about high-quality, clean code, Makers advocate the use of Test Driven Development (TDD), DRY code, and aspects of SOLID design; such as Single Responsibility and Dependency Injection.
* Working on group projects of 4-5 people has given me the opportunity to work in a team environment and to practice daily stand-ups and retros.

##### Final Project:
The Final Project is completed over 2 weeks as part of a team. My team and I delivered a Travel Journal; the primary interface was a map and users can log in through Facebook, drop a pin, and then upload a picture along with comments and a rating. Pins and User details are saved and then reloaded when they next login.

This was a Full-Stack JavaScript application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). Throughout the 2 weeks, we ensured we rotated pairs and responsibilities so that everyone had the opportunity to work on both front-end and backend features.

#### RBW Consulting									Jan 2017 - June 2017
#### IT Recruitment Consultant
RBW Consulting are a well established recruitment consultancy, with teams specialising in the Pharmaceutical and IT industries.  I was brought into the IT Recruitment team to focus purely on Software Developers, predominantly JavaScript experts.

###### My responsibilities:
* Work with existing clients to understand current and upcoming requirements. Including technical skills, commercial experience, and also personal fit.
* Source candidates and have detailed discussions around their skills, experience, and requirements for their next role.
* Build relationships with new, potential clients.

#### Vantage Recruitment Solutions					March 2011 - Nov 2016
#### Senior IT Recruitment Consultant
Vantage Recruitment Solutions are a boutique recruitment agency, specialising solely in the IT market. I started as a Junior IT Recruiter / Resourcer as one of the first members of the team in 2011. For the next 2 years, my role was to source candidates across the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and to work closely with a number of long-term clients.  As the company began to grow, I took on the responsibilities of a Senior IT Recruitment Consultant by building my own client base, meeting clients face-to-face to further understand their culture and working environments, and to assist new members of the team when needed.

Whilst my role required me to recruit a variety of skill-sets across the SDLC, such as Project Managers, Business Analysts, and Scrum Masters etc., the majority of my clients needs were focussed on development itself and as such I primarily focussed on recruiting Software Developers / Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Technical & Solutions Architects, Software Testers & Developers in Test. Also, as many clients were advocates for Agile development practices, I was often required to discuss methods such as Scrum, Kanban, TDD, BDD, and Continuous Integration with candidates in order to assess their suitability for a given a requirement.

###### My responsibilities:
* Meeting with clients to fully understand their projects and technical requirements.
* Worked with a well-known ecommerce company to build a new software development team, in order for them to move from Waterfall to Agile and to rebuild their core web applications with more current technologies.
* Present new opportunities to candidates which meets their requirements and matches their technical skills and experience.
* Expand client base by regularly speaking with new companies and discussing upcoming or ongoing development projects.
* Obtain market feedback regarding the latest, in-demand technologies and methods in order to keep clients updated and sometimes advise them if they're not keeping their development environment up-to-date.
