## Curriculum Vitae

#### Profile
###### Background:
Currently in the process of training to become a Full-Stack Software Developer, I decided to leave my previous job as an IT Recruiter and pursue my real passion by joining Makers Academy. I worked as an IT Recruiter for over 6 years, primarily specialising in hiring Software Development professionals.  This was my chosen industry as I've always had a keen interest in technology - software development in particular - even going back to my school days when I completed a Software Engineering course during Sixth Form. My time spent working in IT Recruitment has given me an awareness of modern technologies and development practices - such as Angular and React JavaScript, SOLID design, Agile, and TDD - which I am keen to learn and eventually use within a commercial, software development environment.

###### Personality:
Possess a strong work-ethic and a genuine enthusiasm  to continue to learn. I am a pragmatic and analytical thinker, who relishes problem-solving and the challenges they provide. This is why I feel my mindset is suited to Software Development and why I get so much enjoyment from coding; it's like solving a puzzle! 

###### Objective:
While there are many interesting opportunities across a wide-variety of industries, my main objective is to join a modern technology company who specialise in high traffic and high transactional systems, such as JustGiving, Just Eat, ASOS etc.


#### Career History:
###### Makers Academy 									Sept 2017 - Jan 2018

###### RBW Consulting									Jan 2017 - June 2017
###### IT Recruitment Consultant
RBW Consulting are a well established recruitment consultancy, with teams specialising in Pharmaceuticals and IT.  I was brought into the IT Recruitment team to focus purely on Software Developers, predominantly JavaScript experts.

###### My responsibilies:
* Work with existing clients to understand current and upcoming requirements. Including technical skills, commercial experience, and also personal fit.

###### Vantage Recruitment Solutions					March 2011 - Nov 2016
###### Senior IT Recruitment Consultant
Vantage Recruitment Solutions are a boutique recruitment agency, specialising solely in the IT market. I started as a Junior IT Recruiter / Resourcer as one of the first members of the team in 2011. For the next 2 years, my role was to source candidates across the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and to work closely with a number of long-term clients.  As the company began to grow, I took on the responsibilities of a Senior IT Recruitment Consultant by building my own client base, meeting clients face-to-face to further understand their culture and working environments, and to assist new members of the team when needed.

Whilst my role required me to recruit a variety of skill-sets across the SDLC, such as Project Managers, Business Analysts, and Scrum Masters etc., the majority of my clients needs were focussed on development itself and as such I primarily focussed on recruting Software Developers / Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Technical & Solutions Architects, Software Testers & Developers in Test. Also, as many clients were advocates for Agile development practices, I was often required to discuss methods such as Scrum, Kanban, TDD, BDD, and Continuous Integration with candidates in order to assess their suitability for a given a requirement.

###### My responsibilites:
* Meeting with clients to fully understand their projects and technical requirements.
* Worked with a well-known ecommerce company to build a new software development team, in order for them to move from Waterfall to Agile and to rebuild their core web applications with more current technologies.
* Present new opportunities to candidates which meets their requirements and mateches their technical skills and experience.
* Expand client base by regularly speaking with new companies and discussing upcoming or ongoing development projects.
* Obtain market feedback regarding the latest, in-demand technologies and methods in order to keep clients updated and sometimes advise them if they're not keeping their development environment up-to-date.
