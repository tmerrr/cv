## Curriculum Vitae

#### Profile
###### Background:
Currently in the process of training to become a Full-Stack Software Developer, I decided to leave my previous job as an IT Recruiter and pursue my real passion by joining Makers Academy. I worked as an IT Recruiter for over 6 years, primarily specialising in hiring Software Development professionals.  This was my chosen industry as I've always had a keen interest in technology - software development in particular - even going back to my school days when I completed a Software Engineering course during Sixth Form. My time spent working in IT Recruitment has given me an awareness of modern technologies and development practices - such as Angular and React JavaScript, SOLID design, Agile, and TDD - which I am keen to learn and eventually use within a commercial, software development environment.

###### Personality:
Possess a strong work-ethic and a genuine enthusiasm  to continue to learn. I am a pragmatic and analytical thinker, who relishes problem-solving and the challenges they provide. This is why I feel my mindset is suited to Software Development and why I get so much enjoyment from coding; it's like solving a puzzle! 

###### Objective:
While there are many interesting opportunities across a wide-variety of industries, my main objective is to join a modern technology company who specialise in high traffic and high transactional systems, such as JustGiving, Just Eat, ASOS etc.
